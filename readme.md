📘 **About this Repository**  
This repository is a structured, time-tracked JavaScript learning sandbox based on the **JavaScript Foundations to Advanced Projects** curriculum from the _Complete Web Development Bootcamp_ by **Hitesh Choudhary** on Udemy.  
It serves as a personal documentation space to build deep clarity in JavaScript, covering everything from core language mechanics to DOM manipulations and real-world mini-projects.
